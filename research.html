      <h3> Introduction</h3>
        <p>
        In order to fully comprehend the functionalities that this CFP Portal Engine will be required to have, extensive research had to be undertaken. 
        This included looking at current platforms that provide a similar or relevant service in order to provide an idea on the structure of their systems,
        functionalities and databases. 
        </p>
        Once a set number of platforms have been identified, the next steps were to make a note of each platform, categorising the functionalities and overall 
        design of their system, looking at the pros and cons, hence providing us with more information on how we would like to build our project proposal engine.
        <p>
        These will be outlined below.
        </p>

        <!--3 platforms that we have researched about-->
     <hr>

        This proposal management software boasts a very large template library that focuses on providing a professional feel to its users. It is implemented as a

        their users full control of the payment. In addition to this, the next steps after a proposal has been approved can be automated, where the web application
        can be used to handle messages, deposits, emails and notifications.

<!-- Personas and Scenarios -->
      <h3> Personas and Scenarios </h3>

      <p> After interviewing various types of users that may use our system, we created personas in order to gather information from the users about the key features they were interested in from our system. The clients gave clear ideas of what they wanted to obtain from the system, but it was important to consider the opinion of general public as ultimately, they would be the main users of the program.  
      </p> Typical users would be people within a company who would submit projects to be reviewed as well as the company's internal reviewing committee who would be responsible for
      reviewing and giving feedback regarding the projects so it was important to consider their needs and importance as a user within the system. 
      </p>
      <h5> Persona 1 </h5>
      &nbsp;
      <img src="img/personas/1.png" alt="Persona 1" style="width:700px;height:600px;">
    </p> <h5>Ralph Hugh (NHS Surgeon) ​</h5>

Ralph is a surgeon working for the NHS who has multiple years of experience in the gastroenterology department. He realizes that there are a multitude of clinical projects that can be conducted to improve the average amount of cholecystectomies. He logs into our Portal Engine to put forth a proposal to carry out a project detailed by him. The Portal connects him to the relevant parties that can carry out his project/test. He then receives feedback on his project within the system's simple interface. Using this, he changes some details of the proposal and resends it. Now, once his project is approved, it will be 
taken on by the abled members of the IXN university student community
</p>
</p>
      <h3> Persona 2 </h3>
&nbsp;
      <img src="img/personas/2.png" alt="Persona 2" style="width:700px;height:600px;">
    </p> <h5>Katie Belinski(Microsoft Project Manager)​</h5>
    <p> Katie is a project manager currently working for Microsoft. She believes there is a need for a portal engine for projects that can analyze previous project data to highlight areas of success and improvement. She logs on to the IXN Portal Engine and views previous, current and future projects that have been proposed. Using this, she filters through the software's database and makes notes of the relevant project data, their success rate, usefulness, completion rate, etc. . By reviewing these, she creates an analysis report that aids her department and boosts her team's productivity.</p>
      </p>We developed scenarios based on these two types of users from different industries to try and pinpoint their key needs and requirements for the system, other than the functionality of it.

<h3> Persona 3 </h3>
      <img src="img/personas/3.png" alt="Persona 3" style="width:700px;height:600px;">
    </p> <h5>Finn Beckett (IBM Project Reviewer)​</h5>
    <p>Finn is a project reviewer currently working for IBM. He overlooks the current state of outgoing projects that IBM exports to third parties. He logs on to the IXN Portal Engine and reviews the proposals that have been submitted by his company. Using the software's feedback user interface, he reviews and comments, placing his opinion on several projects that he believes has potential to be useful to the company. </p>

    </p>
    <hr>  
</p>All the users expressed it was vital for the user-interface to be clear and concise and easy to use. It was important for us to consider features such as a timeline or separating the form into sections in order to make it easier for the user to categorize the information in a logical way. Users also expressed it would be useful to received detailed feedback promptly and an easy process.  

</p>Using these ideas from the scenarios and interviews we started a user-centered approach in designing the initial sketches of the system, iterating the process multiple times in order to obtain the optimal design for a user-friendly system. </p>
