      <h3> Introduction</h3>
        <p>
        In order to fully comprehend the functionalities that this CFP Portal Engine will be required to have, extensive research had to be undertaken. 
        This included looking at current platforms that provide a similar or relevant service in order to provide an idea on the structure of their systems,
        functionalities and databases. 
        </p>
        Once a set number of platforms have been identified, the next steps were to make a note of each platform, categorising the functionalities and overall 
        design of their system, looking at the pros and cons, hence providing us with more information on how we would like to build our project proposal engine.
        </p>
        It is worth noting that current project proposal engines offer a design editor that allows its users to graphically represent their proposal 
        in an artistic and attractive manner, however, in our implementation, these will be entirely handled by forms.
        </p>
        3 project proposal platforms are outlined below.
        </p>

        <!--3 platforms that we have researched about-->
     <hr> 
      <h3> Better Proposals </h3>
      <p> 
        Better proposals is a paid web application with a mobile application option that focuses on simplifying the process of proposing projects to 
        potential clients. Their focus is on providing businesses a very attractive and easy method to propose projects and in turn, getting them signed and approved.
        This is done through their in built "Automatic Designer" application which makes it easy to create good-looking proposals in a matter of minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The link to their website: <a href="betterproposals.io">Better Proposals</a>
      </p>
        <h4> Features </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> "Automatic Designer" page allows users to easily create attractive proposals in minutes</li>
            <li> A multitude of templates are provided, ranging from a variety of themes, that look great on desktop, tablet and mobile devices </li>
            <li> Seamless user interface that focuses on ease of use and access</li>
            <li> Clients can immediately sign your proposal and pay your fees, all from the secure and encrypted weblink that you send them</li>
            <li> A user will be informed when their clients read your proposals, giving you consistent updates</li>
            <li> Reporting and tracking features allow users to monitor the status of their proposals, allowing them to track who's ready for a follow up and who's ready to sign</li>
        </ul>
        
   <hr>

      <h3> Bidsketch </h3>
     <p>
        This proposal management software boasts a very large template library that focuses on providing a professional feel to its users. It is implemented as a 
        web application with no mobile option, unlike Better Proposals. Their platform markets itself as an all in one commercial software that allows business to submit 
        professional looking proposals to their clients. Amongst most features, a notable one worth mentioning is the option to modify and work with fees, allowing 
        their users full control of the payment. In addition to this, the next steps after a proposal has been approved can be automated, where the web application
        can be used to handle messages, deposits, emails and notifications.
     </p>
     <p>
        The link to their website: <a href="www.bidsketch.com">Bidsketch</a>
      </p>
     <h4> Features </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Provides a large template library for users to cut proposal time in half </li>
            <li> Allows users to include optional fees in their proposal document in order to increase revenue </li>
            <li> Provides clients with a professional landing page where they can view, approve, export and comment on their proposal </li>
            <li> Next steps of approved proposals can be chosen to be automated, allowing users to be notified automatically of any progress</li>
            <li> Users are immediately notified of the status of their proposal and given data on their clients, allowing users to improve close rates</li>
            <li> All proposals can be signed off electronically and instantly so that the sales process is expedited quickly </li>
        </ul>
<hr>
        <h3> Qwilr </h3>
        <p>
        Qwilr is centred around a business approach of ensuring its users and clients are happy with the nature, feel and look of their proposals. Their web 
        application includes an extremely easy and simple design interface, which allows users of all experience levels to curate interactive, attractive and 
        mobile-responsive documents. Dynamic and embedded content are an additional selling point, where users can integrate videos, calendars, and even Google Maps
        into their proposals.
        </p>
        <p>
        The link to their website: <a href="www.qwilr.com">Qwilr</a>
        </p>
        <h4> Features </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Provides a designer editor which easily allows users to create polished documents using modular design blocks </li>
            <li> Interactive quoting allows clients to choose the pricing package that fits their needs </li>
            <li> Robust payment system provides clients with the ability to accept, e-sign and pay in one flow, from any device </li>
            <li> Page notifications immediately tells you when a document is viewed or accepted </li>
            <li> Analytics provide insight into how and when prospective clients are interacting with your documents </li>
            <li> Seamless integration with leading CRM, sales and accounting software </li>
        </ul>

        <h4> Learning Points from existing platforms</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Providing the option to utilise templates greatly reduces the difficult and time in creating proposals </li>
          <li> User interfaces, specifically dashboards, must be easy to use, and presented in a clear and concise manner </li>
          <li> Notifications should be sent to relevant parties in the event of any new action (signing, approval, rejection etc. ) </li>
          <li> Ability to electronically sign and pay should be an option </li>
          <li> Tracking of signatures and analytics would be a good addition but not necessary to the functionality of the platform </li>
          <li> Automated responses should be implemented once the platform grows in size </li>

        </ul>
