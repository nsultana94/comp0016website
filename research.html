        In order to fully comprehend the functionalities that this CFP Portal Engine will be required to have, extensive research had to be undertaken. 
        This included looking at current platforms that provide a similar or relevant service in order to provide an idea on the structure of their systems,
        functionalities and databases. 
        </p>
        Once a set number of platforms have been identified, the next steps were to make a note of each platform, categorising the functionalities and overall 
        design of their system, looking at the pros and cons, hence providing us with more information on how we would like to build our project proposal engine.
        </p>
        It is worth noting that current project proposal engines offer a design editor that allows its users to graphically represent their proposal 
        in an artistic and attractive manner, however, in our implementation, due to the simplistic and easy-to-use user requirement, we decided that 
        it was better for data collection to be entirely handled by forms.
        </p>

        Better proposals is a paid web application with a mobile application option that focuses on simplifying the process of proposing projects to 
        potential clients. Their focus is on providing businesses a very attractive and easy method to propose projects and in turn, getting them signed and approved.
        This is done through their in built "Automatic Designer" application which makes it easy to create good-looking proposals in a matter of minutes. [1]

        This proposal management software boasts a very large template library that focuses on providing a professional feel to its users. It is implemented as a 
        web application with no mobile option, unlike Better Proposals. Their platform markets itself as an all in one commercial software that allows business to submit 
        professional looking proposals to their clients. Amongst most features, a notable one worth mentioning is the option to modify and work with fees, allowing 
        their users full control of the payment. In addition to this, the next steps after a proposal has been approved can be automated, where the web application
        can be used to handle messages, deposits, emails and notifications. [2]

  <p> This is a European Platform for sending, collecting and reviewing project proposals. The participants have to find a call/topic, find partners and plan their work and budget. This project came useful when we were researching their 
  way of marking and evaluating the projects, when we were reading through the European policies and regulations that ensured safety for the users and their sensitive data collected via the system. It is also efficient to collect ideas about
  how to display the project collections, how to link in an effective way the submitters with the organisations, the accepted project proposals with the university students or how to map between projects and reviewers. Their easiness and smoothness in
  implementing these flows and rendering the otherwise complicate back-end steps in such a skilfull manner led towards us brainstorming and coming up with useful suggestions for our clients.

              Angular, a TypeScript-based open source web application framework allows users to build apps for web, mobile web, native mobile and native desktop. Its features which 
              will be useful for our system include templating, RESTful API handling and two-way binding. [10]

              ReactJS, arguably the most popular Javascript application framework, allows users to create large web applications. These dynamic pages, can change data without 
              reloading the page. [11]

          <h5>Microsoft Sharepoint</h5>
          Sharepoint was chosen as the solution of choice due to its integration with the Microsoft environment. After conducting several meetings with our clients,
          it was evident that their systems along with UCL's relied on Microsoft. Because of this, it was the perfect choice, as our finished product would be able to
          seamlessly integrate with our clients and the deployment of our solution would not cause any issues. Furthermore, as this project would be in collaboration with the 
          UCL IXN Programme, our system would be ideal for the main users of our system, the UCL IXN team, whose environment mainly relies on Microsoft systems.
        </p>
        <h5> Django </h5>
          Django was chosen as the framework of choice for the public version of our Portal Engine due to influence from our clients, similar to Microsoft Sharepoint. Although there were 
          many other options as outlined above in the "Possible Web Development Tools", we felt that, with agreement from our NHS client, Django provided us with all the necessary tools and
          technologies required to build our dynamic and complex database-driven web application. Furthermore, it was useful that this implementation was in Python, as it was a language
          we felt comfortable with, having went through a module in the first-year of our degree which focused on this programming language. 
          After comparing the key features of Python with a wider gamut of programming languages, we decided this is the language to go. We took into account that
          despite the fact that Python is dynamically typed and required more testing due to potential runtime errors, it comes with extensive libraries and modules that covered our needs in web development. However, we encountered some initial hurdles when using Django because we needed to learn it from scratch. The process of selecting tutorials, of self-teaching, and of putting the theory into practice was thought-provoking and, indeed, challenging.

        After careful consideration, our team decided to develop two separate implementations that provide the same functionalities.
        Due to the nature of requirements posed by our clients, we deemed it best to provide two platforms that are able to carry out all necessary features as outlined
        in the requirements page. Using the learning points stated above, we have made the following technical decisions.
        <ul>
          <li> Include a dashboard page that outlines all projects (accepted, submitted, history)  </li>
          <li> Ensure user interface is as simple and clear as possible </li>
          <li> Automate notifications and responses when a proposal has been submitted, approved or completed</li>
          <li> Use a form based submission system instead of a design/editor page for ease of use</li>
          <li> Allow submitters to request for feedback and approval on their proposal page</li>
          <li> Allow approvers to review feedback provided and decide on a accept/reject decision</li>
        </p>
      </ul>
