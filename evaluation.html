  <h4 style="background:url('img/implementation/greenish.jpg');color:white; padding:10px; margin-left:0px;margin-right:500px;font-size:20px"> User interface / user experience </h4>


        </p> After feedback from the users, most users expressed that the UI was very clear to use and user-friendly. They expressed
        the layout and flow was very clear and simple enough to understand for both systems. Users also expressed that the system 
        successfully achieved the usability goal of effectiveness. The users also expressed
        that the systems were learnable as well as memorable - an important aspect of usability.
      </p>
        In the future, I think our UI could be improved by increasing the feedback of our systems. For instance, it should be clearer which button has been pressed by the user, 
        perhaps by highlighting the buttons. It should also give
        a clearer UI of whether a project has been approved/rejected as well as when a person has successfully given feedback. This could improve clarity 
        of the user-experience. The visibility of the system could also be improved by clearly marking aspects of the system that is clickable, this could be done by changing the colour
        when you hover over the button.
        <p>Furthermore, I would add an interactive help desk for technical issues and other types of problems when utilising the platform and a settings tab. I would extend the comments section through virtual chats between the users, a messaging feature, a mentor or supervisor pairing throughout the platform and a virtual guide to initiate you into how to use the platform. </p>
        
    </p>
    <h4 style="background:url('img/implementation/greenish.jpg');color:white; padding:10px; margin-left:0px;margin-right:650px;font-size:20px"> Functionality </h4>



        </p> We think both systems provide the main functionalities required for a CFP portal. In both systems, the user can submit projects which will be collected and displayed for
        reviewers to view. The reviewers are able to categorise projects and search for them as necessary. Both systems also have the functionality of adding feedback to a project,
        with the criteria being easily changeable in both systems. Finally, in both systems, an approver is able to accept or reject the project by viewing the feedback given, which will be
        stored in an accepted projects database. The users are also able to export the data as required.
    </p>
        However, I think we can improve the functionality of some aspects of both systems. For example, in the Django system, currently the user 
        can only export the full project list or the full accepted list. I think it would have been better if we had added the functionality to export the data that is currently being 
        displayed so results of queries could also be exported too. Also, it would be better if the submitter has the possibility to view the history of the submitted project proposals as well as the accepted and rejected project lists
        in order to gain some grasp and inspiration on what they can develop and come up with in the future. It would also permit for a free, open marketplace of projects as well as a strong network of people who might want to collaborate,
        to guide one another and to provide mentorship, if need be.
</p>
<h4 style="background:url('img/implementation/greenish.jpg');color:white; padding:10px; margin-left:0px;margin-right:650px;font-size:20px"> Stability  </h4>



        </p> Due to the nature of Microsoft Sharepoint, the style and implementation of the lists and flows cannot be altered much as a user. The stability is maintained by Microsoft and as an user you cannot
        change the internal structure of these which may alter the overall functionality and stability of the system. Both technologies have been vastly used within organisations and tested under performance and 
        over a large workload. As a result, the flows and lists are very stable and unlikely to present bugs or errors. 
       </p>
        In the future, it would be beneficial to implement an archiving feature in both systems, as over time the number of projects submitted may overwhelm the system and so may result in instability 
        due to the huge amount of data. The archiving feature could archive the database used and hence reset the project displays.
</p>
<h4 style="background:url('img/implementation/greenish.jpg');color:white; padding:10px; margin-left:0px;margin-right:650px;font-size:20px"> Efficiency   </h4>


  

</p>
        Throughout the multiple tests we ran for both our system, there was not a single crash or fatal error that resulted in a loss of key functionalities. We found 
        that the time taken for a user to log in to our system and carry out the processes that our system was created to handle was quick and straightforward. This is proven
        by the number of users who mentioned that the website ran smoothly and efficiently. Also, we felt that the flow of both our systems were easy to follow
        and the steps in completing tasks while on the platform was clear.
</p>
        In the SharePoint implementation, it would have been better to display the lists according to the projects that have been assigned to you instead of 
        the entire collation of projects, as this may be difficult to sort through and display. This may have been more efficient for the users, 
        as otherwise they have to filter or search through it accordingly.
</p>
<p>
In the Django implementation, it would have been smart to use emulator devices in an emulation systems in order to adjust the widths and the heights on each view in the CSS files every time one was created. It would also have been efficient to create more factory and abstract classes
that would allow a common trunk of methods, variables and similar elements with the permission to extend and specialise their functionalities later in other classes.
</p>
<h4 style="background:url('img/implementation/greenish.jpg');color:white; padding:10px; margin-left:0px;margin-right:650px;font-size:20px"> Compatibility   </h4>


        
        We found that our SharePoint website was very compatible with a multitude of browsers and screen sizes. Due to the fact that the back-end of the website
        is Microsoft-based, we found that there were no issues with scaling and sizing, making the platform usable for all devices. We also found that the website ran on both 
        operating systems (Mac and Windows) which was expected. 

</p>
        In the Django system, in the future I think it would have been beneficial to implement a single sign on method into the system. This prevents a user from creating a new 
        account solely for our system, and would have allowed them to use their pre-exisiting account. We were unable to implement this due to 
        lack of time, but in the future I think this would have increased compatibility of the Django system with many different organisations, as they could have integrated their
        pre-existing credentials with our system.
    </p>
        Moreover, in the Django testing revealed that some elements of our system were not rendered by our browser and were not being displayed. For instance, a user using a 2010 iMac using Safari could not view the submission portal. I think in the future, it would be better
        if we could test our system on multiple operating systems and devices as all three team members use a relatively new MacOS laptop, and so may not be an accurate representation of the systems which are used in organisations such as a NHS 
        which may have a large variety of different systems in terms of operating system, model and age. In the future, we would have preferred to test the compability of our system thoroughly and also have formatted it to be 
        usable on mobile devices, as currently it is only formatted correctly using a laptop. Many users may not necessarily use a laptop for this feature, and so in the future it would be good to develop this for mobile devices too. 

</p>
<p>
We developed the open-source Django platform to be compatible for precise screen sizes. This is due to the fact that we did not take into account deploying our web portal for the NHS client on smartphones or other smaller-sized screen gadgets at this point. During implementation and development, it was easier to stick to one specific size and gadget, which is a desktop and create the user interfaces from ground up intended only for laptops. However, the front-end was developed to use containers that were not fixed and fluid to the size of the screen. Initially, our side bar was fixed and our layout was fixed which causes display issues when changing the screen size from full screen. However, by changing the layout and containter types as well as adding an option to temporarily hide the navigation bar, this reduced the disarray from changing the screen size so all the key content was still shown and visible to the users. 
</p>
<h4 style="background:url('img/implementation/greenish.jpg');color:white; padding:10px; margin-left:0px;margin-right:650px;font-size:20px"> Maintainability </h4>


</p>
        The SharePoint system is very easy to maintain due to the robust nature of the system. Power Automate handles the majority of the back-end and is well maintained by Microsoft. 
        If a flow failed, the owner would receive emails alerting them of this as well as the source of the error. As a result, any bugs can be easily fixed or improvements can 
        be made easily to flows. However, any bugs found in the execution of the flows or the lists may be more difficult to fix due to the inability 
        to change the internal structure of these as a regular user. If these bugs persist, a problem is that you will have to depend on Microsoft to fix these issues internally.
</p>
<p>
During meetings with our NHS client, regarding the maintainability of the Django platform, we found out that the NHS technical side is quite old fashioned which made us focus on delivering a product that is able to satisfy the internal software and hardware usage encountered on a regular basis within NHS. Therefore, since the compatibility testing emphasised potential disruptions and hurdles to adjust to the client's system, we started working on a virtual environment, which we installed for the sole purpose of preserving the installations and configurations that are implemented in Django and Python with the most recent versions, but be able to acclimate quickly on our client's technical environment according to any versions of software they might use and any operating system. 
</p>
<p>
In terms of the maintainability under the lens of high-level refactoring, at first, we tackled the high-level refactoring, which revolved around the comprehensive and adequate applying and implementation of the above-mentioned design patterns since we wrote some perfunctory code in the first place that characterised through lower quality , higher
redundancy, poorer structure.
</p> Regarding the low-level refactoring, we were concerned about minimising or even
eliminating redundancy issues. A later method through which we refactored was to split methods, to change the methods’ and variables’ names so they reflected in a more aggregated and targeted purpose as well as better comprehensibility and consistency.
</p>
       <h4 style="background:url('img/implementation/greenish.jpg');color:white; padding:10px; margin-left:0px;margin-right:650px;font-size:20px"> Project management </h4>

       <br>

       <p>
       We divided the project into subsystems, allocating tasks according to members’ personality traits, expertise, and preferences for better coordination and teamwork, utilising the DevOps practice. We constantly assessed the progress done holistically and by every teammate, which kept us on track, given the advancement through the course materials and resources as well as the time frames and logistics. We had a precise time over the weekend to video call given the discrepancy in our schedules and got prepared in advance of the meetings with notes, ideas and suggestions to yield to productive discussions. We could have improved the quality and efficiency of our meetings through sprints to augment the overall development process.
       </p>
        Our project management as a team was greatly aided by the use of the Gantt Chart and the Trello board. We communicated well through the use of Whatsapp groups and 
        utilised Microsoft Teams as a means for video calling/meeting with clients. We tried to ensure that our project was constantly up to date, 
        by referring to our deadlines and trying to meet them.
</p>
        To keep all our files safely stored in the cloud, we created multiple channels within our team in Microsoft Teams and organised them accordingly. This not only provided us a means
        to access any document when required but to allow efficient collaboration within a single document. This was very useful when creating our team presentation and deliverables.
</p>
        To improve, we felt that we could have utilised more of the in built functionalities within git, as our entire project had multiple repositories (Django code,
        report website, etc) and if there were more parts to our projects, it was likely that our code would have not been organised in a clear manner.

        There are multiple things we wanted to implement and progress further, however could not due to lack of time. For example:
        </p>
        <li> Include a single sign on (SSO) option for the Django implementation so users can integrate their pre-exisiting accounts to the system, preventing the need to create a new account from scratch </li>
        <li> Greater front-end styling and implementation for the SharePoint solution so it can be integrated into the site with this styling.</li>
        <li> Functionality in both system for users to subscribe to the system. </li>
        <li> More advanced querying in the django and a more sophisticated technique of database storage </li>
        <li> Implement ML/AI solutions to provide suggestions of project proposals based on previous projects, as well prompting users for possible tags they could use. </li>
        <li> Clear validation with instructions and warnings for incorrectly filled in fields in forms. </li>
        <li> Implementing the idea of networks of people based on their interests, expertise that can connect via the platform. </li>
        <li> Add an interactive help desk for technical issues and other types of problems when utilising the platform and a settings tab.</li>
        <li> Extend the comments section through virtual chats between the users, a messaging feature, a mentor or supervisor pairing throughout the platform</li>
        <li> Add virtual guide to initiate you into how to use the platform. </li>
