      </p> Throughout the project we tried to adapt the agile technique of Test-Driven Development. This allowed us to test constantly after we implemented each feature, and allowed to us to ensure that each feature was fully functional and bug free before we continued working
      on another feature. We were able to adapt pair programming through the development process and so as a result, we were able to give feedback on each other's code and test for bugs. We would also have frequent code reviews of each other's code
      in order to make sure the code was seamless and bug free. 

      </p> As we were trying to do TDD, this revealed to us many bugs as we developed, but they were easy to solve as it was easy to pinpoint the source of the bugs. This is because, we would only push to the main branch in the repo  only if the code was functioning and so we knew that it was working up until that point.
      We also made great use of the github branch funtionality, so created branches for different versions of the code so we could preserve fully working code and implement new features on a new branch so we could test thoroughly before merging the branches.
      
      
      </p>Throughout the development process, we tested each feature thoroughly by testing the functionality as we went. For instance, for testing the submission portal, we tested the system's response to a submission with correct data formats, and then a submission with incorrect data formats, and ensured the
      results were as expected.

      starting the implementation of the display of the projects. 
      
      </p>We created multiple instances of test data to ensure the system was doing as aspected. The expected function of the submission portal was that it should store the submission details
      into a database, which is displayed by the system and can be queried and filtered accordingly.

      When developing the SharePoint site, the most important aspect to test was the power automate flows. Therefore, after
      designing the flow, we tested each individual flow's functionality using Microsoft's inbuilt test functionality. This allowed us to manually trigger the flow by creating arbitrary data ourselves 
      or automatically triggering the flow using a recent response or trigger. This allowed us test each flow separately, isolated from the entire system, and the system would show whether the 
      flow failed or succeeded. It would show the point of failure clearly in the diagram, and so we were able to fix and restructure the design as we developed. By testing the
      flows individually, we could be confident that any source of bugs in functionality were not from the individual flows as we would be alerted by email if the flow failed.

      We developed the open-source django platform to be compatible for all screen sizes. The front-end was developed to use containers that were not fixed and fluid to the size of the screen. 
      Initially, our side bar was fixed and our layout was fixed which causes display issues when changing the screen size from full screen. However, by changing the layout and containter types as well as 
      adding an option to temporarily hide the navigation bar, this reduced the disarray from changing the screen size so all the key content was still shown and visible to the users.
      
      </p>
      We also tried to test on different operating systems and devices. However, given the nature of the pandemic, it was difficult to obtain a large variety of devices and operating systems as all our devices used MacOS and our family 
      and friends also used similar devices, and this could only be tested after deployment. However, the testing did reveal some bugs in compatibility that should be addressed in the future.

      We ran our Sharepoint site across multiple devices (smartphone and tablet) and there were no drawbacks regarding the key functionalities of the system. However, our system was not 
      designed for small screens and therefore a user may find it more difficult to navigate the website due to the lack of screen space. We also ran our site across multiple browsers (Firefox,
      Chrome, Opera, Safari) and there were no issues.

We were unable to perform alpha testing during development due to the nature of the pandemic, as we could only run our application on the localhost. Therefore, we were only able to test
the system after deployment to a server. 

It was difficult to get a variety of test cases and testers given the current pandemic as we could not ask a variety of different ages or people, other than students 
or family. In an ideal situation, we would have liked to get feedback from more people with a non-technical background and a variety of ages and technical experience.

    <td> I like how the design has been done. The display/arrangement of all the elements in page is orderly and elegant, so that everything is aligned just fine, with nice margins separation lines or boxes between them for a clear division. I like that I know what to press and what that is used for because of the concise names and labels given.
    </td>
    <td> By using the platform a bit I've realised it is effective enough to be used at a large scale by many institutions because it maps very efficiently and clearly all the submitted project proposals with their reviews, it provides links via the system between the users and their specific functions across the platform.
    </td>
    <td> It is very easy to learn what to do, given that the submitter cannot do much more apart from submitting a project and viewing their list of submitted proposals. However, I would incorporate more functions in the future for the finished product.
    </td>
    <td>I personally would like to see a pallet of colours made of 
     hues that are not that strong, like that prevailing blue, because it might become tiring at times, especially when using the platform for long hours and with a higher screen brightness.</td>
    <td> It is a high-quality piece of software, with it can be inferred that it has a strong implementation with a various usage of modules, libraries etc. in order to create such complex forms, validation for some fields, the search bar, the hashtags clustering etc. It can be used at a large scale and with some adjustements and further improvements, I do believe it can support tens of hundreds or even more users simultaneously without any server issues as many platforms in my experience confront with. 
    </td>
    <td> I love the software, I would personally recommend to partner with various institutions beyong the clinical range, from different domains and countries, because I am sure in the legal, educational etc. areas there is a need for such a call-for-projects platform at an international level.

   <td> I like how the interfaces contain similar elements of design, matchy hues, models, patterns. The care to the tiniest detail is fantastic (e.g. the folded corners of the containers match, the degree of roundedness of boxes, the hovering effects etc.). I noticed that the prevailing colour is the NHS' blue colour, which makes me appreciate the developers' sense of responsibility for customisation and adjustement according to specificity of the client.
   </td>
   <td> I think the submitter's functionalities can be extended so that they can see others' projects, get inspired by their submissions, eventually team up with other submitters, get into contact etc, because when I logged in as a submitter, I only saw an empty home page and a tab in the sidebar menu with the respective submission portal. I was expecting to be able to get the contact details of some fellow submitters, to be able to access some non-private, unbounded by any priviliege or confidentiality information about past projects and it would be useful to see clusters of projects based on acceptance, rejection, search bar etc. as they are visible for reviewers and approvers.
   </td>
  <td> The learning component can be easily achieved if using the platform at least 2-3 times, because the design, the components and the direction statements integrated as brief guidelines under several elements are all comprehensively done and included very well so that they match the exact intended functionality.
  </td>
  <td> It has been a nice experience to navigate through the platform and explore its functions. The elements are all visible, I particularly liked the review portal the way it has been done, the forms, the comment section with that collapsable accordion as well as the red-amber-green visual section that is very memorable. I found confusing the transparent boxes in the review dashboard at first because the buttons underneath the project title were not visible, but then it started making sense why the programmers opted for that design since by hiding the buttons, the page remained unstuffed and clean. 
  </td>
  <td> The platform is largely scalable, can become very useful since it is open-source and easily deployable across different clouding systems and servers and used with various operating systems. I like the innovation behind the implementation and the strength of both front-end and back-end. 
  </td>
  <td> I would think of implementing the idea of networks of people based on their interests, expertise. I would add an interactive help desk for technical issues and other types of problems when utilising the platform and a settings tab. I would extend the comments section through virtual chats between the users, a messaging feature, a mentor or supervisor pairing throughout the platform and a virtual guide to initiate you into how to use the platform. But definitely, a very interesting and complex project.

    <td> The interface is really simple and easy to follow. I particularly like the dashboard/home page where navigating to other site pages is just a click away. The overall look of the site
      is rather plain and monotonous, however, understandable since the platform will only be used in a professional environment.

    <td> 
      The platform definitely does the job of submitting, storing, organising and allowing users to request for approval and provide feedback. The large list with multiple columns
      keeps everything in one place, making it easy to navigate around. Also, the submission portal is simple but detailed.
