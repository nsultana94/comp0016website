          <p>
            For each test, you should explain why you do this test, which test tool you use, how you
            conduct the test, what results you get, and your analysis or conclusion to the results.
          </p>
      <h3> Testing Strategy </h3>

      </p> Throughout the project we tried to adapt the agile technique of Test-Driven Development. This allowed us to test constantly after we implemented each feature, and allowed to us to ensure that each feature was fully functional and bug free before we continued working
      on another feature. We were able to adapt pair programming through the development process and so as a result, we were able to give feedback on eachother's code and test for bugs. We would also have frequent code reviews of each other's code
      in order to make sure the code was seamless and bug free. 

      </p> As we were trying to do TDD, this revealed to us many bugs as we developed, but they were easy to solve as it was easy to pinpoint the source of the bugs. This is because, we would only push to the main branch in the repo  only if the code was functioning and so we knew that it was working up until that point.
      We also made great use of the github branch funtionality, so created branches for different versions of the code so we could preserve fully working code and implement new features on a new branch so we could test thoroughly before merging the branches.
      
      
      </p>Throughout the development process, we tested each feature thoroughly by testing the functionality as we went. For instance, for testing the submission portal, we tested the system's response to a submission with correct data formats, and then a submission with incorrect data formats, and ensured the
      results were as expected.
      </p>

      <h3> System Testing </h3>

      
      </p>When developing the key features, we tested each process in small increments as we developed. For instance, when developing the submission portal, we tested whether the data was correctly being stored into the database before
      starting the implementation of the display of the projects. 
      
      </p>We created multiple instances of test data to ensure the system was doing as aspected. The expected function of the submission portal was that it should store the submission details
      into a database, which is displayed by the system and can be queried and filtered accordingly.

      <h3> Unit and Integration Testing </h3>
      
      When developing the SharePoint site, the most important aspect to test was the power automate flows. Therefore, after
      designing the flow, we tested each individual flow's functionality using Microsoft's inbuilt test functionality. This allowed us to manually trigger the flow by creating arbitrary data ourselves 
      or automatically triggering the flow using a recent response or trigger. This allowed us test each flow separately, isolated from the entire system, and the system would show whether the 
      flow failed or succeeded. It would show the point of failure clearly in the diagram, and so we were able to fix and restructure the design as we developed. By testing the
      flows individually, we could be confident that any source of bugs in functionality were not from the individual flows as we would be alerted by email if the flow failed.

</p> ----ADD MORE --- 
      

      <h3> Compatibility Testing </h3>
      We developed the open-source django platform to be compatible for all screen sizes. The front-end was developed to use containers that were not fixed and fluid to the size of the screen. 
      Initially, our side bar was fixed and our layout was fixed which causes display issues when changing the screen size from full screen. However, by changing the layout and containter types as well as 
      adding an option to temporarily hide the navigation bar, this reduced the disarray from changing the screen size so all the key content was still shown and visible to the users.

      <h3> Performance and Stress Testing </h3>
      </p>
      For the SharePoint implementation, the system will hopefully be used for future IXN project proposals. As a result, the system should be tested thoroughly 
      with the huge amount of proposals which will be submitted. 
      </p>
      <h3> User Acceptance Testing</h3>
</p>
We were unable to perform alpha testing during development due to the nature of the pandemic, as we could only run our application on the localhost. Therefore, we were only able to test
the system after deployment to a server. 

It was difficult to get a variety of test cases and testers given the current pandemic as we could not ask a variety of different ages or people, other than students 
or family. In an ideal situation, we would have liked to get feedback from more people with a non-technical background and a variety of ages and technical experience.

     <td>19 years old, Computer Scientist </td>
     <td> Red buttons correspond to warnings so the information buttons should not be red. In the review feedback form, the buttons on the right should be in order.
     The UI is clear to understand and does not have too many elements. Bar chart in read-only feedback looks confusing as it looks like an error and the layout is clean and simple, but very usable. 
     </td>

     <td> Colour scheme is very effective for visualisation of the data. Mapping is successful. Mental map of each action is easy to remember. </td>
     </td> 
     <td> Should remove buttons that do not work as otherwise unclear.
     Tags are very easy to use as a users. Colours make state of projects very clear.
    </td>
    <td> In the submission portal, Saachi felt that the previous button should be on the bottom left of the window. 
   File is too far down the page for something that important, in the project detail page. 
    </td>
    <td>  Submission portal should give prompt if something is filled out incorrectly </td>
    <td> The layout of the portal is extremely is well designed and easy to use. With a bit of polish, it would be perfect. It is the
    functionality of each of the buttons, and I able to see each process I am able to do as a user clearly. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Jack Bradley </td>
     <td>22 years old, non-technical user </td>
     <td> 	The dates on the form, should be clickable and year-month-day. Another suggestion is that the Project ID should be on the project grid as well as the table. The tags are very clear and the project grid layout is very easy to understand.
     In the review portal, the UI is very clear to use and easy to understand what you have to do.

     </td>

     <td> 
     It did everything it was supposed to do, and was easy use to use. </td> 
     <td> The system is very memorable and easy to understand what to do once you have submitted a proposal. Mapping was also clear to understand and not too many buttons so it wasn’t confusing. 
    </td>
    <td>
    Project ID should be on the projects and more clear on the project grid for consistency between layouts. Perhaps make it so you can click on the card than the title as it may not be clear which part to click to view the project details.
    </td>
    <td> Buttons could change colour to show which button you’ve pressed and which tab you’ve opened as otherwise it may be confusing for the user. It should also include a confirmation of approval of projects, it should be larger or have a pop up at the top so its clearer. Some sort of big notification as you couldn’t tell that its been accepted. 
    The buttons were clearly labelled and it was easy to understand what they were doing, as well as what you couldn't do. </td>
    <td> 	Very smooth and usable, and it’s easy to use.A very nice layout and it looks very professional and user-friendly. 
 The colours and representation make it very easy to see and contrasted enough so all the elements are visible and clear.
