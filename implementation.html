      <h4> <span class="badge badge-warning">The SharePoint Platform</span></h4>
        <p>
        Implementing the design in <i>SharePoint</i> was a challenging process as our team were not familiar with the user interface of the design page, and the 
        multiple <i> Power Apps </i> that were available to us. However, due to the extensive research and prototyping that had been done, we began to learn the ropes of the 
        SharePoint interface and after a number of weeks, the majority of the functionalities were implemented as intended.

        </p>
        Once a set number of platforms have been identified, the next steps were to make a note of each platform, categorising the functionalities and overall 
        design of their system, looking at the pros and cons, hence providing us with more information on how we would like to build our project proposal engine.
        <p>
        The features will be outlined below in-depth.
        </p>

      <h4> <span class="badge badge-warning">The Django Platform</span></h4>
        <p>
        We designed the open-source system using the <i>Django</i> web framework for back-end, which heavily relies on Python as the core programming language. <br><br>We felt more comfortable 
        coding in Python, nevertheless, we took into consideration a wider gamut of programming languages and wisely compared their key features. Despite the fact that Python is 
        dynamically typed and required more testing due to potential runtime errors, it comes with extensive libraries and modules that covered our needs in web development. 
        However, we encountered some initial hurdles when using Django because we needed to learn it from scratch. The process of selecting tutorials, of self-teaching, and of putting the theory into practice was thought-provoking and, indeed, challenging. 
        <br><br>As regards to the front-end development, we decided to employ <i>Bootstrap 4</i>, a free and open-source framework. Our choice was backed up by its exhaustive assembly comprised of <i>CSS, HTML, JavaScript</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
        We have successfully deployed our web portal using the <i>SQLite3 Database</i>. We opted for this relational database, given that it is part of the Python distribution. Also, when building up the skeleton of the project, Django automatically generated a reliable setup for an SQLite3 
        back-end database. 

        </p>

      <h5> <span class="badge badge-warning"> SharePoint </span></h5>

      The submission portal was implemented using the exisiting functionality of Microsoft Forms.
      The form was separated into sections for a more user-friendly experience. 
      The form is connected to a list within the SharePoint site, which will automatically add the data of the new responses to the list using Microsoft Power Automate. 
      </p>The data is then presented catagorically in a Microsoft List which can then be filtered, and queried with the inbuilt features within Microsoft Lists. 
      Data in the fields of are visually represented using pills, and a range of different views based on the need of the reviewer.
      </p>

        <div class="caption" align="center">Fig. Microsoft Power Automate flow for project proposals</div>
        </p> The image above shows the flow of data in the submission of projects. When a project is submitted, this acts as a trigger for this flow which obtains the response details and adds it to the
         appropriate project submissions list with the correct data and adds it to the excel sheet storing the project proposals.</p>
      <h5> <span class="badge badge-warning"> Django </span></h5>

      <p> The submission portal in Django was implemented using in-built Django forms which allowed us to access the fields required from the Person model. Below there is the Person table with all the requested information 
      for both the submitter and the details specific to the project proposal. All the Django models are classes implemented as subclasses of the <code>django.db.models.Model </code> and will therefore be able to integrate within them various fields, methods and metadata.
      </p>

      <div class="container" style="background-color:#EAEAEA; padding:10px;" >
      <pre class="brush: python notranslate"><code>my_field_name <span class="token operator">=</span> models<span class="token punctuation">.</span>CharField<span class="token punctuation">(</span>max_length<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">20</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> blank<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">True</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> default<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">""</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> verbose_name<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">'Enter field info'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></code></pre>
     
      </div>

      <p>Our above example is a field called <code>my_field_name</code>, of type <code>models.CharField</code> — which means that this field will contain strings of alphanumeric characters. The field types are assigned using specific classes, which determine the type of record that is used to store the data in the database, along with validation criteria to be used when values are received from an HTML form (i.e. what constitutes a valid value). The field types can also take arguments that further specify how the field is stored or can be used. </p>
      <p> In the Person model we defined fields such as name, project_title, summarised_abstract, department, organisation etc. of type <code>models.CharField</code>, but we added fields of types <code>models.TextField</code> that allowed us to define a larger text area spanning on multiple rows and columns, of type <code>models.EmailField</code> for validating emails, <code>models.URLField</code> for GIT links, or <code>models.ChoiceField</code> for the data which had to display to the user a series of options to choose from.

            </pre>
      </div>
      <p> The submission portal is implemented using the smart wizard forms in Django, so that it allows for an efficient division of the whole form into 5 steps based on categories (submitter's details, abstract etc.). As stated in the figure below, the Form class will be linked to the respective Model class
      by describing how the fields are structured and look like when displayed in a form. The fields of the <code> Proposal Form class</code> map to the < <code> input</code> > tags in the HTML file via <code> forms.ModelForm. </code> A form field will be displayed in the front-end interface to the user as a widget (overriding the Widget class) that has been previously mentioned in each field of the form. </p>
     <p> For a clean and elegant rendering of the submission portal form, we have opted for importing the <code> Django crispy forms module </code>. It provided us with the <code> |crispy </code> filter and <code> {% crispy %} </code> tag, that provides some in-build customisation for the form, along with the validation of the email, phone or date and time fields.  </p>

     <p> In order for the HTML file to recognise the correct usage of the crispy-forms modules, we had to load the module through <code>{% load crispy_forms_tags %} </code> and to refer to a field in a specific section of the view, we included <code>  {{ form.field_name|as_crispy_field}} </code>   </p>
       <center><img src="img/implementation/submissionportalforms.png" alt="Evaluation"  width="60%" ></center>
       <pre><div class="caption">             Fig. Proposal Form in forms.py   </div></pre>
      <p>When a submitter submits a project for approval, this sends a POST request to the backend server of Django which stores the data appropriately into the Project model alongside their unique indexes. This data is then displayed in a table in the project dashboard ordered 
      by submission date, by iterating through the stored instances in the Project. 
      </p>

       <pre><div class="caption">             Fig. SubmissionPortal() view method in views.py   </div></pre>
      <p>
      With the use of the Django-filters libraries, an extensive query can be performed based on multiple fields which is implemented in the projects grid and lists which can query projects based on specified criteria by the user
      so projects can be categorised according to preference. 
      </p>
      The <code> Taggable Manager Library  </code> is used to parse tags with the use of JavaScript and Bootstrap so tags can be associated with projects.

     extra feedback details. These feedback details will then be appended to the feedback columns in the proposal submissions list, and the number of red/amber/green ratings will be incremented based on the reviewer's answer.
     </p>This will then be used to update the specific project in the SharePoint list as well as the excel sheet to reflect the newly added changes.
     </p> The list column is formatted using json to only show when a project has not been accepted / rejected and clicking on the button will trigger the flow, and only members within the site organisation who can edit the site are able to trigger the flow.</p>

     <h5> <span class="badge badge-warning">Django  </span></h5>
     <p>Only the users with the authenticated permission of a reviewer can have access to the Review Portal. An IXN Lead or the so-called approver is able to assign reviewers on the page of every specific projects. The assignment is done in back-end through a POST request 
     that allows the selection from a drop-down menu from among the reviewers, that are stored as a Many-to-Many field in the Person model. The code is displayed below: </p>
       <center><img src="img/implementation/reviewers.png" alt="Evaluation"  width="60%" ></center>
       <pre><div class="caption">       Fig. Assigning Reviewers in the projectdetail() method in views.py   </div></pre>
    
      <p>After the assignment is completed, the reviewers are notified in the system that there are projects left to be reviewed. At this point, the reviewer can see the list of all the projects that have been assigned to review particularly to them and are redirected towards 
      the Review Portal page associated in the URL with the unique index (primary key) of the project being reviewed. The information filled in for a review is stored in the <code> Review model </code>which has an identical mechanism with the Person model. We have similarly defined the fields. 
      The field types are assigned using specific classes, which determine the type of record that is used to store the data in the database, along with validation criteria to be used when values are received from an HTML form. The Review Model in <code> models.py </code> is presented in the figure below with its constituent fields:

         </p>
         <div class="row">
        <img src="img/implementation/reviewmodel1.png" alt="Evaluation"  width="50%" >
         <img src="img/implementation/reviewmodel2.png" alt="Evaluation"  width="50%" >

         <pre><div class="caption">   Fig. Review Model Part 1 in models.py                               Fig. Review Model Part 2 in models.py</div>
            </pre>

        <p>In the Review model we defined fields such as the link to the project being reviewed, defined as a Foreign Key to the Person model, reviewer's details and the comments based on specific criteria, of type <code>models.CharField</code>. We also added fields of types <code> models.IntegerField </code> that allowed us to define the scores the reviewer
         can give for the 7 criteria. In order to compute the scores appropriately, we overrode the save() method, so that when a reviewer opts for a certain score from the 0 to 5 options of the radio boxes provided under each criterion, the system will save the raw score up to 5 in criterion_namePoints field, but will also convert the points on a scale up to 100 
         and saves the mathematical calculation in criterion_namePoints100 when submitting the form. Similarly, the saving is done automatically with the load and submission of the review form and the fields <code> self.points </code> will store the summation of the seven scores, up to a total of 35, and <code> self.score </code> will convert this sum on a scale from 0 to 100, through the rule of three.
        </p>

        <p> The Review Portal is done using the <code> crispy_form module</code> in Django.  As stated in the figure below, the Form class will be linked to the respective Model class by describing how the fields are structured and look like when displayed in a form. The fields of the Review Form class map to the < input > tags in the HTML file via forms.ModelForm. A form field will be displayed in the front-end interface to the user as a widget (overriding the Widget class) that has been previously mentioned in each field of the form. 
        </p>
        <div class="row">
        <img src="img/implementation/reviewform1.png" alt="Evaluation"  width="50%" >

            </pre>
      
        When a reviewer submits a review for a project, this sends a POST request to the backend server of Django which stores the data appropriately into the Review model alongside its primary key and the foreign key to the Person model.
        In order to create the correct link between the project and its review, we have implemeted the data dictionary which gathers the primary key of the project taken from the argument passed from the URL and the project, filtered from the Person model using this id.
        Using the foreign key attribute from the Review model, we instantiated the results object within the body of the form.is_valid() if-statement, and stored the inputs from the reviewer in the <code> results.project.field_name</code>, where the field_name is a valid field declared in the Person model.
        
      </p>

            </pre>

               This data is then displayed in a tile-fashion in the review dashboard under the view all projects tab ordered by review date, by iterating through the stored instances in the Project. 
        One can choose to view only the projects that are under review or the projects that are assigned to them to be reviewed. The same option buttons will appear for each view under each project title, namely the button of visiting the project page, the button of visiting the list of all the available feedbacks and reviews up to date and the the button stating the status of the project, i.e., a link to the review portal if the reviewing period is still open.

      approver of the project, giving details of the project, the feedback, the RAG ratings and list of reviewers. This starts a Microsoft Approval process, where the approver can accept or reject the project through that and this will
      update the status accordingly based on the answer. If the project is accepted, a new item will be created in the Accepted Projects list and the submitter will be informed via email.

      Once the list of a maximum number of 10 reviews has been made available from the reviewers on the view feedback and review under each project in the reviews dashboard, a lead or the so-called approver is now able to log in and accept or reject the project. 
      The reviews are in the read-only format, so that the approvers can have a holistic overview of the reviews and can make an informed decision whether or not to pursue the project. 
      Both the approval and the rejection are done through a GET request method and assessing which reference of the two accept/reject button is sent to the method. Depending on the action button, the accepted or rejected projects database is reloaded and the current project is stored accordingly, as well as its display in the respective views.py
      Also, the system automatically sends an email through the send_mail() method to the submitter in order to inform them upon the final decision of the approver regarding their project proposal.

     <h5><span class="badge badge-warning"> Django  </span></h5>
     <p> In terms of the databases, we used SQLite3 because of its self-contained, small, yet feasible and reliable relational database management system that comes at once with the installation, configuration and lauching of the Django backbone project. 
     It is configured by default in the <code> settings.py </code> file under the databases, as follows: </p>
     <center><img src="img/implementation/sqlite3.png" alt="Evaluation" width="400" height="100" ></center>

     <p> We handled the database through SQL Server Management software, where we created and updated the tables before the actual implementation in the Visual Studio Code in order to make sure the code will not break and to ensure the accessibility and avoid the troubleshooting issues when integrating within the whole system
     The database contains several tables enlisted as classes, which we implemented in the <code> models.py </code> file. 
     The core ones are Person model and Review model. The fields in the models are of the structure below:
     </p> 

    
  
      <div class="container" style="background-color:#EAEAEA; padding:10px;" >
      <pre class="brush: python notranslate"><code>my_field_name <span class="token operator">=</span> models<span class="token punctuation">.</span>CharField<span class="token punctuation">(</span>max_length<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">20</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> blank<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">True</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> default<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">""</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> verbose_name<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">'Enter field info'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></code></pre>
     
      </div>

      <p>Our above example is a field called <code>my_field_name</code>, of type <code>models.CharField</code> — which means that this field will contain strings of alphanumeric characters. The field types are assigned using specific classes, which determine the type of record that is used to store the data in the database, along with validation criteria to be used when values are received from an HTML form (i.e. what constitutes a valid value). The field types can also take arguments that further specify how the field is stored or can be used. </p>
      <p> In the Person model we defined fields such as name, project_title, summarised_abstract, department, organisation etc. of type <code>models.CharField</code>, but we added fields of types <code>models.TextField</code> that allowed us to define a larger text area spanning on multiple rows and columns, of type <code>models.EmailField</code> for validating emails, <code>models.URLField</code> for GIT links, or <code>models.ChoiceField</code> for the data which had to display to the user a series of options to choose from.

         <pre><div class="caption">         Fig. Person Model Part 3 in models.py                                      Fig. Person Model Part 4 in models.py</div>
            </pre>
      </div>
<p>
      The information filled in for a review is stored in the <code> Review model </code>which has an identical mechanism with the Person model. We have similarly defined the fields. 
      The field types are assigned using specific classes, which determine the type of record that is used to store the data in the database, along with validation criteria to be used when values are received from an HTML form. The Review Model in <code> models.py </code> is presented in the figure below with its constituent fields:

         </p>
         <div class="row">
        <img src="img/implementation/reviewmodel1.png" alt="Evaluation"  width="50%" >
         <img src="img/implementation/reviewmodel2.png" alt="Evaluation"  width="50%" >
         </div>
         <pre><div class="caption">   Fig. Review Model Part 1 in models.py                               Fig. Review Model Part 2 in models.py</div>
            </pre>

        <p>In the Review model we defined fields such as the link to the project being reviewed, defined as a Foreign Key to the Person model, reviewer's details and the comments based on specific criteria, of type <code>models.CharField</code>. We also added fields of types <code> models.IntegerField </code> that allowed us to define the scores the reviewer
         can give for the 7 criteria. In order to compute the scores appropriately, we overrode the save() method, so that when a reviewer opts for a certain score from the 0 to 5 options of the radio boxes provided under each criterion, the system will save the raw score up to 5 in criterion_namePoints field, but will also convert the points on a scale up to 100 
         and saves the mathematical calculation in criterion_namePoints100 when submitting the form. Similarly, the saving is done automatically with the load and submission of the review form and the fields <code> self.points </code> will store the summation of the seven scores, up to a total of 35, and <code> self.score </code> will convert this sum on a scale from 0 to 100, through the rule of three.
        </p>

        <p> Besides, there are three more models, namely AcceptedProjects, RejectedProjects, and UnderReviewProjects, which contain a foreign key, one-to-one field towards the Person model. The models are listed below: </p>

        <div class="row">
        <img src="img/implementation/accepted.png" alt="Evaluation"  width="33%" >
         <img src="img/implementation/rejected.png" alt="Evaluation"  width="33%" >

         <pre><div class="caption">Fig. AcceptedProjects Model         Fig. RejectedProjects Model                    Fig. UnderReviewProjects Model</div>
            </pre>

            <p> The users can export the projects' details along with their respective submitter's information in the form of CSV files by pressing the specific button in the home page, the project grid and list. 
            The function sets up a csv file in the media URL we have specififed and initialises a writer. This writer then iterates through the entries in the database 
            and writes it to the csv.

     <p> There are three types of authenticated permission users, namely submitters, reviewers and approvers. As admin, we were able to log in the Django system's database and configure the Group's permissions. </p>

            </pre>
            <p> The code we employed for writing the permissions bases on filtering the user.groups. The methods check what type of user the request user is, and the views are limited based on the result of the method. 
            By adding <code> @is_reviewer </code> to the top of a view method, this allowed only users which passed the boolean method to execute that view method and render the html. Therefore, submitters cannot access the review portal 
            even if they input the url into their browser, as the view could not be accessed by them. </p>

     </p> The flows described above can be exported as a zip, which can be imported into another organisation's SharePoint site by importing the zip file and changing the connections. The connections can then be changed to the appropriate lists and users and deployed within 
     an organisation's own SharePoint site. This is explained in the deployment video in the Appendicies.

     </p> The lists can be replicated within a SharePoint organisation site by running the site script provided. This will need to be done by the adminstrator of the organisation's Sharepoint. The site design can then be applied to the 
     site and this creates the lists
     with the correct formating and styling, which can then be appended to pages and integrated into an existing SharePoint site.

      In order to deploy the Django web portal properly, open two bash terminals (one for the local server and one for the remote) - the commands will be alternative. 

      Set up a LINODE account (we used Linode for our cloud computing and web hosting service). The IP address of the REMOTE website can be found in the Network tab under the IP addresses or via the SSH Access.
      We will use Ubuntu for the operating system needed to deploy the web portal. The series of instructions and their explanations are provided step-by-step in the Django Deployment Manual that can be found in the Appendices section.
