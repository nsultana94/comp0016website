        <p>The existing IXN scheme used Microsoft Forms to collect potential projects for students to develop. Therefore, 
        there was limited functionality in terms of organisation of data and collection of the projects. As a result, the CFP Portal Engine was required to be developed.
        A system which uses existing IXN functionality such as the Microsoft form to efficiently collect and organise data 
        while allowing a committee of reviewers to give feedback and review these projects and decide whether they will be accepted or rejected. 
        </p>
        Its main purpose is to provide an efficient way of categorising projects and visually filtering projects based on certain criteria 
        such as the project complexity, approval status, technical challenges, etc. This collation of project proposals will then be stored within the database and 
        can be viewed by the reviewers and approvers of our system.
        </p>
        UCL will primarily use this system for the collection of projects for the IXN program, and will deploy the system over the UCL intranet as all students enrolled in this program 
        will have access.

        Microsoft and IBM intend to use this system for the collection of projects within their own company, and ease of providing students with the opportunity
        to collaboratively create and develop solutions for current technological issues. This will not only improve relationships between clients and students who
        will eventually enter the industry but will also allow students to showcase their talents and highlight their ability in the field of computer science.
        </p>
        The NHS intend to use this system in order to expedite the process of approving projects within their organisation. Our client, Dr Joseph Connor, states
        it is an extremely valuable resource to have university students working and prototyping on projects that have the ability to solve current medical issues
        within the NHS. Providing students with project briefs to work on is multiple times quicker than approving a project through the usual channels,
        due to the sheer size of the national health organisation.

      <p> We designed some Google forms and surveys which helped us assess the external requirements and necessities as pointed out by users of different age categories, backgrounds, technical exposure, user interface needs etc. </p>
      </p> Main requirements is an easy-to-orientate, user-friendly interface.
   
    </p>
           <h6 style="background:url('img/implementation/greenish.jpg');color:white; text-align:center;padding:10px; font-size:18px"> Finding common requirements and features as suggested by clients</h6>
<p>
We believed in equipping our platform with the common features as discovered throughout the process of gathering requirements, during our interviews. We found it important to include characteristics like making one of the two systems an open-source tool so that outside people who are willing to submit a project proposal, but still uncertain about the topic, the area of interest, the structure of a successful past project etc., can gain easy access to this open marketplace where successful project proposals are collected and displayed. </p>
<p>
Another similar aspect was to include a structured easy-to-orientate and user-friendly interface. Through it users can smoothly follow the instructions, tick the mandatory and optional boxes with the steps before uploading a project, have the option to edit their application or personal information and see the progress throughout filling in an application form as well as the general overview when their application has been satisfactorily completed. 
</p>
<p> The review portal has to incorporate a core set of criteria which are due to being established alongside our client. However, on the review page, a reviewer might have the option to create additional fields and comment sections so that they do not feel constrained by giving a feedback on a criterion which may be N/A, i.e. not relevant for the respective project. The Green-Amber-Red is a common feature as well and one of the paramount ones.

<!-- Personas and Scenarios -->

      <p> After interviewing various types of users that may use our system, we created personas in order to gather information from the users about the key features they were interested in from our system. The clients gave clear ideas of what they wanted to obtain from the system, but it was important to consider the opinion of general public as ultimately, they would be the main users of the program.  
      </p> Typical users would be people within a company who would submit projects to be reviewed as well as the company's internal reviewing committee who would be responsible for
      reviewing and giving feedback regarding the projects so it was important to consider their needs and importance as a user within the system.

    <h5>Finn Beckett (IBM Project Reviewer)​</h5>
    <p>
      Finn is a project reviewer currently working for IBM. He overlooks the current state of outgoing projects that IBM exports to third parties.
       He logs on to the IXN Portal Engine and reviews the proposals that have been submitted by his company. 
       Using the software's feedback user interface, he reviews and comments, 
       placing his opinion on several projects that he believes has potential to be useful to the company.

    </p> <h5>Katie Belinski (Microsoft Project Manager)​</h5>
    <p> 
      Katie is a project manager currently working for Microsoft. She believes there is a need for a portal engine for projects that can analyze 
      previous project data to highlight areas of success and improvement. She logs on to the IXN Portal Engine and views previous, 
      current and future projects that have been proposed. Using this, she filters through the software's database 
      and makes notes of the relevant project data, their success rate, usefulness, completion rate, etc. . 
      By reviewing these, she creates an analysis report that aids her department and boosts her team's productivity.
    </p>
      We developed scenarios based on these two types of users from different industries to try and pinpoint their key needs 
      and requirements for the system, other than the functionality of it.

       <h5>Ralph Hugh (NHS Surgeon) ​</h5>

      Ralph is a surgeon working for the NHS who has multiple years of experience in the gastroenterology department. 
      He realizes that there are a multitude of clinical projects that can be conducted to improve the average amount of cholecystectomies. 
      He logs into our Portal Engine to put forth a proposal to carry out a project detailed by him. 
      The Portal connects him to the relevant parties that can carry out his project/test. 
      He then receives feedback on his project within the system's simple interface. Using this, he changes some details of the proposal and resends it. 
      Now, once his project is approved, it will be taken on by the abled members of the IXN university student community.
    </p> 

    </p>
    <hr>  
</p>All the users expressed it was vital for the user-interface to be clear and concise and easy to use. It was important for us to consider features such as a timeline or separating the form into sections in order to make it easier for the user to categorize the information in a logical way. Users also expressed it would be useful to receive detailed feedback promptly and an easy process.  

</p>Using these ideas from the scenarios and interviews we started a user-centered approach in designing the initial sketches of the system, iterating the process multiple times in order to obtain the optimal design for a user-friendly system. </p>

  <p> We have created the unique use case diagram for our two systems, which have the same aim, processes and follow the very same flow of commands and instructions for the three users per each system. The diagram incorporates three levels, which we defined 
  by a specific colour. It is easy to follow and to understand because it creates a visual layering of the system flows. There are some steps which are identical for different types of authenticated users, therefore we marked this down in our diagram by 
  superimposing the arrows in a clear and effective manner. 
  </p>
  <p> The brief walk through our diagram starts from delineating the types of users, i.e., submitters and reviewers. It can be noted that approvers will have the very same functionalities as reviewers do. The starting point bases on logging in the system by selecting
  the appropriate role (submitter, reviewer or approver) that filters throught the authenticated permissions and allows the user to sign in but view only the limited range of elements and functions only they are entitled to access.
  </p>
  <p> For a submitter, the core element revolves around submitting a project proposal, where they can fill in a step-by-step form and provide necessary evidence. After a successful submission, the collection of their projects is stored in the main history list or table with everything they have sent via our portal. These users can also fill in and submit their company's details.</p>
  <p> For a reviewer, the system will redirect them towards the same history of the submitted project proposals which they can view, search through, filter, export as CSV. They can separately view the accepted, rejected or under review project proposals. The main role of a reviewer is to review the projects to which they have been assigned and provide feedback based on that.
  Additionally, based on each project's collection of reviews, an approver can accept or reject the project.

      We used the MoSCoW Analysis for the prioritisation of implementing different features based on requirements which we have been continuously gathering from both users and clients. In order to come up with a viable and solid MoSCoW list, we previously strengthened the power of every prioritization element through a set of tailored queries. We asked ourselves and our clients during the interviews the questions presented below in order to create a comprehensive, yet straightforward list.
      
      </p>


      <h6 style="background:url('img/implementation/greenish.jpg');color:white; text-align:center;padding:10px; font-size:18px"> How did we come up with the MoSCoW list?</h6><br>
      <br> <h6><b> Questions we asked in order to conceive the MUST-HAVE list: </b></h6>
      <ol>
      <li>Will the exclusion of this requirement affect the overall project development in the long run? </li>
      <li>How will our project be impacted if this requirement is not included at all?</li>
      <li>How will our project work without that particular requirement?</li>
      <li>Why do we find it mandatory to implement it?</li>
      <li>Can the requirement be replaced or simplified by another one?</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
    
     <h6><b> Questions we asked in order to conceive the SHOULD-HAVE list: </b></h6>
      <ol>
      <li>Why is this requirement’s characteristic not compulsory to be implemented? </li>
      <li>Should we take into consideration that the requirement was somehow covered or implemented better or more efficiently in the must-haves?</li>
    
      </ol>
      <br>

       <h6><b> Questions we asked in order to conceive the COULD-HAVE list: </b></h6>
      <ol>
      <li>Why would it be nice to include this requirement? </li>
      <li>Why do we assess it as having a smaller impact than others integrated in the system?</li>
      <li>What is the possible outcome of including this requirement?</li>
      
      </ol>
      <br>

       <h6><b> Questions we asked in order to conceive the WILL NOT-HAVE list: </b></h6>
      <ol>
      <li>Why is not important to include this requirement? </li>
      <li>In what way will the inclusion of this requirement affect the overall process (eg. breaching the system, breaking the existent features etc.)?</li>
      <li>What are the negative aspects related to its implementation? (eg. too time consuming, requires too many resources etc.)</li>
  
      </ol>
