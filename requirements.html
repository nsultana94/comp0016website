      <h3> Project Background </h3>
        <p>The existing IXN scheme used Microsoft Forms to collect potential projects for students to develop. Therefore, 
        there was limited functionality in terms of organisation of data and collection of the projects. As a result, the CFP Portal Engine
        is a system which uses existing IXN functionality such as the Microsoft form to efficiently collect and organise data 
        and allow a committee of reviewers to give feedback and review these projects and decide whether they will be accepted
        or rejected. 
        </p>
        It allows an efficient way of categorising projects and visually filtering projects based on certain criteria such as the project complexity, approval status, technical challenges, etc.
        </p>
        UCL will primarily use this system for the collection of projects for the IXN program, and will deploy the system over the UCL sharepoint as all users within UCL
        will have access to this system through the UCL intranet.
        </p>
        NHS and Microsft intend to use this system for the collection of projects within their own company, specifically for students and universities to collaboratively 
        create and develop.

      <h3> Project Goals </h3>
      <p> </p> 

      <ul>
      <li> Efficient project proposal collection that is easy to use</li>
      <li> Clear project data organisation and visualisation</li>
     <li>Feedback system which is easy to use and allows each project to be reviewed and approved/rejected accordingly</li>
     <li> Integrated database for seamless data distribution </li>
     <li> Seamless userflow with no amiguities </li>

      </ul>
   <hr>
      <h3> Requirement gathering </h3>
      <p> We conducted a series of virtual semi-structured interviews via audio-video calls through platforms like Zoom or Microsoft Teams and discussed permanently throughout email in order to schedule the meetings, to ask some follow-up questions or rise our concerns in terms of the desired 
      requirements versus the materials and time we had or just different sides of a perspective. </p>
      <h4> Gathering user requirements </h4>
      <p> We designed some Google forms and surveys which helped us assess the external requirements and necessities as pointed out by users of different age categories, backgrounds, technical exposure, user interface needs etc. </p>
      </p> Main requirements is an easy-to-orientate, user-friendly interface.
    </p> We believed in equipping our platform with the common features as discovered throughout the process of gathering requirements. We found it important to include characteristics like making the portal an open-source tool so that outside people can gain easy access to this open marketplace where successful project proposals are collected and displayed.
    </p> Another similar aspect was to include a structured easy-to-orientate, user-friendly interface through which users can smoothly follow the instructions, tick the mandatory and optional boxes with the steps before uploading a project, have the option to edit their application or personal information and see the progress throughout filling in an application form as well as the general overview when their application has been satisfactorily completed.

<!-- Personas and Scenarios -->
      <h3> Personas and Scenarios </h3>

      <p> After interviewing various types of users that may use our system, we created personas in order to gather information from the users about the key features they were interested in from our system. The clients gave clear ideas of what they wanted to obtain from the system, but it was important to consider the opinion of general public as ultimately, they would be the main users of the program.  
      </p> Typical users would be people within a company who would submit projects to be reviewed as well as the company's internal reviewing committee who would be responsible for
      reviewing and giving feedback regarding the projects so it was important to consider their needs and importance as a user within the system. 
      </p>
      <h5> Persona 1 </h5>
      &nbsp;
      <img src="img/personas/1.png" alt="Persona 1" style="width:700px;height:600px;">
    </p> <h5>Ralph Hugh (NHS Surgeon) ​</h5>

Ralph is a surgeon working for the NHS who has multiple years of experience in the gastroenterology department. He realizes that there are a multitude of clinical projects that can be conducted to improve the average amount of cholecystectomies. He logs into our Portal Engine to put forth a proposal to carry out a project detailed by him. The Portal connects him to the relevant parties that can carry out his project/test. He then receives feedback on his project within the system's simple interface. Using this, he changes some details of the proposal and resends it. Now, once his project is approved, it will be 
taken on by the abled members of the IXN university student community
</p>
</p>
      <h3> Persona 2 </h3>
&nbsp;
      <img src="img/personas/2.png" alt="Persona 2" style="width:700px;height:600px;">
    </p> <h5>Katie Belinski(Microsoft Project Manager)​</h5>
    <p> Katie is a project manager currently working for Microsoft. She believes there is a need for a portal engine for projects that can analyze previous project data to highlight areas of success and improvement. She logs on to the IXN Portal Engine and views previous, current and future projects that have been proposed. Using this, she filters through the software's database and makes notes of the relevant project data, their success rate, usefulness, completion rate, etc. . By reviewing these, she creates an analysis report that aids her department and boosts her team's productivity.</p>
      </p>We developed scenarios based on these two types of users from different industries to try and pinpoint their key needs and requirements for the system, other than the functionality of it.

<h3> Persona 3 </h3>
      <img src="img/personas/3.png" alt="Persona 3" style="width:700px;height:600px;">
    </p> <h5>Finn Beckett (IBM Project Reviewer)​</h5>
    <p>Finn is a project reviewer currently working for IBM. He overlooks the current state of outgoing projects that IBM exports to third parties. He logs on to the IXN Portal Engine and reviews the proposals that have been submitted by his company. Using the software's feedback user interface, he reviews and comments, placing his opinion on several projects that he believes has potential to be useful to the company. </p>

    </p>
    <hr>  
</p>All the users expressed it was vital for the user-interface to be clear and concise and easy to use. It was important for us to consider features such as a timeline or separating the form into sections in order to make it easier for the user to categorize the information in a logical way. Users also expressed it would be useful to received detailed feedback promptly and an easy process.  

</p>Using these ideas from the scenarios and interviews we started a user-centered approach in designing the initial sketches of the system, iterating the process multiple times in order to obtain the optimal design for a user-friendly system. </p>
